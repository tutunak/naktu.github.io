        <h2>About</h2>
        <ul style="text-indent: 10px">
          <li>I have a strong background in working with the Ansible automation tool, which has allowed me to
            effectively manage and maintain infrastructure. I have experience in automating builds and deployment
            processes using a variety of tools such as Teamcity, Jenkins, and Github Actions. This has allowed me to
            streamline these processes and make them more efficient. In addition, I have a good understanding of
            monitoring systems such as Zabbix, Prometheus, and Cloud Watch. I am also familiar with the Docker
            containerization tool, which is an important technology in the field of containerization and container
            orchestration.</li>
          <li>I have a good amount of experience working with Linux-like operating systems such as Centos, Ubuntu, and
            Amazon Linux. I have also worked with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, which is a popular cloud
            computing platform that offers a wide range of services and tools for building, deploying, and scaling
            applications.
          </li>
          <li>In addition to my experience with Ansible and AWS, I am also experienced in Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
            using Terraform. I also have some knowledge of AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), which is a software
            development framework for defining cloud infrastructure in code. Additionally, I have strong programming
            skills in Python which I have used to automate and streamline various processes.
